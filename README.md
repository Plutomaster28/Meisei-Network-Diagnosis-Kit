# Meisei-Network-Diagnosis-Kit
I stayed up all night and was really fucking tires of punching in the same commands, but then i realized that people also don't know what to do, so I made this program to make it more accessible (not easier) for anyone to diagnose their network.

**ALWAYS** run `ipconfig` as your first command or `help` if you need help with commands or need your IP address, only skip these if you either know what you're doing or already know your IP address.
For some commands, such as `tracert` for instance, you can input a website instead of a direct address if you prefer. If you wish to do this, I recommend using `www.microsoft.com` as your target website.
